Abstract
-
 
The main scope of project is to send commands 
from one cell phone to be received by another cell phone 
mounted on the kit to receive the 
DTMF (Dual Tone Multi 
Frequency) mode commands which are then decoded. The 
corresponding codes are then fed to a microcontroller, 
programmed to recognize those codes to operate a relay as 

device will
 
operated.
 
                     
The aim of the proposed system is to develop a 
cost effective solution that will provide controlling of devices 
such as industrial devices, home appliances remotely and 
enable home security against intrusion in the absence o
f 
homeowner. The system provides availability due to 
development of a low cost system. The home appliances 
control system with an affordable cost was thought to be 
built that should be mobile providing remote access to the 
appliances and allowing home secu
rity.

1.1   OVERVIEW
 
In this system, we are going to develop a cellular phone 
based home/office appliance. This system is designed for 
controlling arbi
trary devices, it includes a cell phone (not 
included with the system kit, end user has to connect his/her 
cell phone to the system) which is connect to the system via 
head set. To active the cellular phone unit on the system a 
call is to be made and as th
e call is answered , in response 
the user would enter a two/three digit password to access 
the system to control devices. As the caller press the specific 
password , it results in turning 
on or  off
  
specific devices. 
The  device switching .[2]
 
 
2. METHODOLOGY
 
2.1 Working Principle
 
Power supply of 230 volt is fed in to the transformer which 
step down that voltage in to 12volt supply. A full wave 
                                        
                  
 
 
bridge rectifier is used to convert ac voltage in to dc value   , 
then this 
 
12 volt dc value fed in to voltage re
gulator which operates at 
12volt dc which converts unregulated dc value in to 
regulated dc value. Voltage regulator is also used here to 
make good performance of transistors and ics what here 
used. Now a cell phone is connect with the circuit, when 
caller 
make call on that cell phone ) ICs to generate DTMF 
corresponding to a number or code in the number pad and to 
detect the same number or code from its corresponding 
DTMF. In detail, a DTMF generator generates two 
frequencies corresponding to a number or co
de in the 
number pad which will be transmitted through the 
communication networks, constituting the transmitter 
section which is simply equivalent to a mobile set. In the 
receiver part, the DTMF detector IC, for example IC MT 8870 
detects the number or cod
e represented by DTMF back, 
through the inspection of the two transmitted frequencies. 
Now that  frequency generated is fed in to microcontroller 
then transmit to relays  after receiving necessary operating 
voltage  relay starts switching on and off proces
s of devices.

2.3  Characteristics of Embedded System
 

 
An embedded system is any computer system 
hidden inside a product other than a computer.
 

 
They will encounter a number of difficulties when 
writing embedded system software in addition to 
those we encounter
 
when we write applications
 

 
Power consumption 

 
Portable systems must run on 
battery power, and the software in these systems 
must conserve power
 
2.4  Classification
 

 
Real Time Systems.
 

 
RTS is one which has to respond to events within a 
specified deadline.

answer.

4.1 Transformer(
230/12)
 
In this project we use step down transformer, which 
converts 230/12 V ac, 1A .Three wires are used in output. 
One Green and yellow wire gives 500mA and another green 
and yellow wire gives 500mA.so, total output currant is 
1A.[6]

For a positive half cycle of the input voltage, the 
polarities of the secondary voltages are shown in figure. This 
condition forward biases diode D1 and reverse biases diode 
D2. 
The current
 
path is through D1 and the load resistor RL.
 
 
 
For a negative half cycle of the input voltage, the 
voltage polarities on the secondary are shown. This 
condition reverse biases D1 and forward biases D2. The 
current path is through D2 and RL

input cycle is in the same direction through the load the

Any electrical or 
electronic device
 
that maintains the 
voltage of a

is needed to keep voltages within the

equipment using that voltage.[5]

4.4  DTMF Decoder
 
4.4.1 Description
 
Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) codec is used 
to encode and decode the key strokes in a telephone. It can 
also be used to perform a basic data transfer operation. The 
MT8870D/MT8870D
-
1 is a co
mplete DTMF receiver 
integrating both the band split filter and digital decoder 
functions. The filter section uses switched capacitor 
techniques for high and low group filters; the decoder uses 
digital counting techniques to detect and decode all 16 DTMF 
t
one pairs into a 4
-
bit code. External component count is 
minimized by on chip provision of a differential input 
amplifier, clock oscillator and latched three
-
state bus 
interface.[3]
 
4.4.2 Working
 
Telephone signaling is based on encoding keypad 
digits using
 
two sinusoidal of different frequencies, hence 
the name DTMF. Each digit is represented by a low 
frequency and a high frequency sinusoid. The frequencies 
used were recommended by AT&T such that no two 
frequencies are integral multiples of each other. This
 
facilitates correct decoding even in the presence of non 
linearity of filters which cause higher harmonics to be 
present.
 
4.4.3  Diagram
 
 
Fig. DTMF generator kit 
 
 
                    
Fig: DTMF generated
 
signal
 
It was also necessary to replicate the generation 
section of code in order to produce two sine waves. These 
two waves were then added together, and sent to the analog 
interface circuit ready for transmission. DTMF, or Dual Tone 
Multi Frequency, is 
a method of sending and receiving 
control information over a communications channel. The 
reader is probably most familiar with DTMF tones as heard 
on a modern push
-
button telephone.

A cap
acitor or condenser is a passive electronic 
component consisting of a pair of conductors separated by a 
dielectric. When a voltage potential difference exists 
between the conductors, an electric field is present in the 
dielectric. This field stores energy 
and produces a 
mechanical force between the plates. The effect is greatest 
between wide, flat, parallel, narrowly separated 
conductors.[7]

7. CONCLUSION
 
In the advancing world of 21st century there need to 
be controlling devices in almost all 
the places viz. home 
[controlling of various appliances], office [electronic 
authentication for access to a specific cabin, restricted area 
etc.], factory [control and instrumentation], public places [ 
traffic signal control automatic railway crossing sign
al 
control etc.] etc. All these controls should be achieved via 
easily available public level interface like power line, 
telephone line or through internet. And the medium through 
which the objective is to be achieved depends on the device 
to be controlled
 
and the placement of the device. For our 
project we have decided to use mobile as a medium for 
controlling devices since we are basically devising a system 
that will be user friendly, would be used to control the 
appliances from any corner of the world an
d will still 
maintain privacy and restrict access to the unauthorized 
user.
 
According to the recent trends we can use GSM for 
controlling the home appliances from anywhere in the 
world. With the help of GSM we can receive the system 
information via SMS. Bu
t compared to DTMF the cost of GSM 
is very high and hence in our project we are using DTMF.

System reliability can be
 
improved.
 
              

      
 
Wide spread of automation.
